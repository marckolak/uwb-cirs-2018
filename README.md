# Dataset: UWB Channel Impulse Responses Registered in a Furnished Apartment

[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

This dataset contains ultra-wideband (UWB) channel impulse responses (CIR) registered in a fully furnished apartment.
The data were used to assess the effectiveness of an Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) detection algorithm described in the paper:
 
 M. Kolakowski and J. Modelski, **“Detection of direct path component absence in NLOS UWB channel,”** in 
 *2018 22nd International Microwave and Radar Conference (MIKON)*, Poznan, Poland, May 2018, pp. 247–250,
 doi: [10.23919/MIKON.2018.8405190](https://doi.org/10.23919/MIKON.2018.8405190)
 
 The CIRs were collected using Decawave EVK1000 Evaluation Kit for 57 different modules' geometric configurations.
 Besides the CIR measurements, the modules performed ranging.
 The results were saved using the DecaRanging application. More detail one the dataset can be found in the `dataset_description.pdf` file.
 
The dataset is to be cited as follows:
